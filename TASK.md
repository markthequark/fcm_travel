# FCM Digital - Elixir Technical challenge

As we want to provide a better experience for our users we want to represent their itinerary in the most comprehensive way possible.

We receive the reservations of our user that we know is based on SVQ as:

```
BASED: SVQ

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight SVQ 2023-03-02 06:40 -> BCN 09:10

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Hotel BCN 2023-01-05 -> 2023-01-10

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight SVQ 2023-01-05 20:40 -> BCN 22:10
SEGMENT: Flight BCN 2023-01-10 10:30 -> SVQ 11:50

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Train SVQ 2023-02-15 09:30 -> MAD 11:00
SEGMENT: Train MAD 2023-02-17 17:00 -> SVQ 19:30

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Hotel MAD 2023-02-15 -> 2023-02-17

RESERVATION
SEGMENT: Flight BCN 2023-03-02 15:00 -> NYC 22:45
SEGMENT: Flight NYC 2023-03-06 08:00 -> BOS 09:25
```

But we want to expose the following format:

```
TRIP to BCN
Flight from SVQ to BCN at 2023-01-05 20:40 to 22:10
Hotel at BCN on 2023-01-05 to 2023-01-10
Flight from BCN to SVQ at 2023-01-10 10:30 to 11:50

TRIP to MAD
Train from SVQ to MAD at 2023-02-15 09:30 to 11:00
Hotel at MAD on 2023-02-15 to 2023-02-17
Train from MAD to SVQ at 2023-02-17 17:00 to 19:30

TRIP to NYC, BOS
Flight from SVQ to BCN at 2023-03-02 06:40 to 09:10
Flight from BCN to NYC at 2023-03-02 15:00 to 22:45
Flight from NYC to BOS at 2023-03-06 08:00 to 09:25
```

We want an Elixir program that gets the input from the file `input.txt` and prints the expected output.

Take into account the following aspects:

- You should implement the sort and grouping logic of the segments.
- You can assume that segments wonâ€™t overlap.
- IATAs are always three-letter capital words: SVQ, MAD, BCN, NYC
- You can use external libraries if you want.
- You can attach notes explaining the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.
- You may consider two flights to be a connection if there is less than 24 hours difference.

You can reply to the email you received if you have any doubt.

In order to submit your solution, create your own Git repository and send us by email when it is ready.

Thank you very much for your time and good luck!
